Project Description
Wabi Roti is a playful React app that lets users upload a photo of their chapati/roti and analyzes its roundness and burn marks using a backend service. The app features a walking chef animation and fun feedback on your roti's perfection.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
How do you know if your chapati is truly round and not secretly a potato? The world needs a way to judge rotis for their wabi-sabi beauty.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Upload your roti, and let our AI chef analyze its roundness and burns. Get instant feedback and celebrate your perfectly imperfect chapati!
